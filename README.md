# ClangHelper

A helper software for conlanging.

The usage of this program should be fairly self-explanatory, if not, I will add a wiki or something here later.

Also; since I'm working on a custom programming language, choosing "clanghelper" wasn't the best of names, since clang is a well-known c compiler using llvm.


If you're building this yourself, you're gonna need eclipse's SWT library for your OS.
